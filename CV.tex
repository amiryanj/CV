\paragraph{Doctoral Researcher @ \href{http://crowdbot.eu} {CrowdBot}}(European H2020 Research Project) \hfill Jan. 2018 - Jun. 2021\\
CrowdBot focuses on developing platforms and algorithms to ensure safe navigation of social robots.
My main task is to develop tools for \textit{Motion Prediction} of pedestrians around the robot, to improve robot navigation in crowd. I'm working on Crowd Simulation algorithms and Deep Learning models. As a result I developed a model called \enquote{Social-Ways} that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to take agent's observed trajectories and predict multi-modal distribution of their future trajectories.

\paragraph{Computer Vision Engineer @ \href{http://pixballsports.com}{PixBall}}  \hfill May 2015 - Dec. 2017\\
PixBall is an AI startup providing smart solutions for sports video analysis. My task was developing image processing and machine vision algorithms and providing high-level API for UI layers. I contributed to PixArt, a video processing software for embedding graphical overlays and virtual advertisements into sports contents. One of the most challenging parts was to estimate the camera calibration parameters in near real-time. In this process only rotation and intrinsic parameters need to be updated, since the camera location is usually fixed, during a game. We used Matlab symbolic toolbox to derive the tracking equations and convert it to C++ instructions. Then we used a Levenberg–Marquardt solver with a set of tracked keypoints to find the parameters.

\paragraph{Computer Vision Engineer @ \href{http://www.spadsystem.com/}{Spad System Co.} } \hfill Apr. 2016 - Nov. 2017\\
At Spad-system I started a project for automatic recognition of Iranian license plates \href{http://didbaan.com}{(Didbaan)}. I developed a ALPR engine based on an open-source software (OpenALPR). We collected and annotated +5k plate images and trained the system to detect plates and recognize Persian letters. This software has been in use to manage the entrance and exit of cars from parkings in multiple sites.
%I designed a tool for detecting moving objects using motion segmentation technique and also optimized an existing LBP descriptor to find the plates regions in the image. Furthermore I implemented a Persian OCR module using standard C++ libraries to extract the content of the plates.

% describe small size project
\paragraph{Co-Founder and Team Leader @ {Cyrus}}(Team of Small-Size Soccer Robots) \hfill Jul. 2010 - Apr. 2015\\
%A team of 6 small mobile robots play soccer on a green carpeted field that is 9 m long by 6 m wide. Small Size robot soccer focuses on the problem of intelligent multi-agent cooperation and control in a highly dynamic environment with a hybrid centralized/distributed system. 
I co-founded \textbf{Cyrus} under the supervision of Dr. Eslam Nazemi, during my undergrad study. I collaborated with more than 20 undergrad and graduate students that joined the team to develop hardware and software of the robots and prepare them for Robocup competitions. My main role was in the technical management of the project. Moreover,  I contributed to designing the electronic boards, programming the robot firmware, and latterly developing codes for motion planning and playing of the robots. As research results of the project, we presented a new approach to improve the robot movements and compensating inaccuracies in robot building using a Fuzzy approach. We also proposed a new motion-planning algorithm for the robots, that is able to adapt the navigation parameters by optimizing multiple objectives, simultaneously.
