## Professional Experience

### Postdoctoral Researcher @ [ISIR (Robotics Lab - Sorbonne University)](https://isir.upmc.fr/)
**Sep. 2023 - Oct. 2024**  
As part of the euROBIN project, I focused on developing social navigation algorithms for mobile robots such as Pepper and Tiago. This included integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) into the robot navigation stack using ROS. Collaborating with the LAAS robotic center in Toulouse, I contributed to advancing the robots' capabilities for human-aware navigation.

### CTO and Head of AI @ [Vive Robotics](http://vivetennis.com)
**Mar. 2021 - Aug. 2023**  
As the CTO and Head of AI at Vive Robotics, I led the development of the Vive Tennis Robot, a tennis-ball-retriever robot that utilizes advanced Computer Vision and AI algorithms to efficiently navigate on the court, locate tennis balls, and identify players. My primary responsibility has been to oversee the delivery of an MVP, by setting specific numerical targets for each principle. I guided the AI team in developing a high-fps embedded video processing pipeline that maximizes the robot's agility while ensuring cost-effective hardware solutions to maintain an affordable device price.

### Co-Founder of [DecorAR](http://decorar.ai) @ Inria Startup Studio
**April. 2022 - Mar. 2023**  
DecorAR is a tech project incubated at Inria Startup Studio to bring AI and Visual Recommendation to Augmented Reality environments. "_Interior Design by AI_" is the first platform being developed by DecorAR, and it addresses the problem of finding compatible pieces of furniture among a vast database of products from different categories and brands. As a CTO, my job was to build ML models and develop the stack to make the PoCs accessible to early testers.

### Doctoral Researcher @ [Inria](http://inria.fr) (EU H2020 Project)
**Jan. 2018 - Jul. 2021**  
I contributed as a doctoral researcher to developing tools for *Motion Prediction* of pedestrians around robots to enhance navigation in crowded environments. Leveraging GANs, I developed the “Social-Ways” model to predict multi-modal distributions of future trajectories based on observed agent motion. This work honed my expertise in PyTorch, Keras, and large-scale data analysis, with significant focus on neural network training and visualization.

### Computer Vision Engineer @ [PixBall](http://pixballsports.com) (Previously Sepehr)
**May 2015 - Dec. 2017**  
At PixBall, I specialized in designing high-performance camera calibration algorithms and 3D computer vision solutions for sports video analysis. I developed optimization algorithms in C++ to improve accuracy in overlay placement and created systems to handle variable lens distortions at different zoom levels. These advancements were key to enhancing PixArt, a video processing software for embedding graphical overlays and virtual advertisements in soccer match content.
