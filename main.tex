% describe small size project
\paragraph{Team Leader @ \href{http://robocup.sbu.ac.ir}{Cyrus Robotics}}(Small-Size Soccer Team of Shahid Beheshti Univ.) \hfill 2010 - 2015\\
%A team of 6 small mobile robots play soccer on a green carpeted field that is 9 m long by 6 m wide. Small Size robot soccer focuses on the problem of intelligent multi-agent cooperation and control in a highly dynamic environment with a hybrid centralized/distributed system. 
Besides experiencing a professional team work management of seven graduate and undergraduate students, I heve been designing and developing electronic boards and embedded systems of the robots as electronic designer until 2012. During this period, a small wireless network was formed using Zigbee technology to enable communication between robots. Decision commands sent from Off-field computer were parsed and executed with ARM-based micro-controller that run a PI controller to  drive the robot wheels at a desired speed and trigger the kicker module.\\
After 2012 I joined the software group and rewritten AI codes to c++. I developed the motion planning module based on an idea in my MSc thesis. We also introduced an approach to improve the robot movements and compensating inaccuracies in robot building using a Takegi-Sugeno fuzzy method.
In 2014 we implemented a speech recognition system to convert human voice signals into robot commands in order to facilitate robot learning.

\paragraph{Computer Vision Expert @ Sepehr Etelaat Co.} (Related to Sharif Univ.) \hfill May 2015 - present\\
Sepehr is a computer vision based company that develop solutions in sport analysis. My job is developing image processing and vision algorithms and providing high-level API for UI programmers. My current project is a software for adding virtual advertisement to sport videos. A main processing step in this system is to estimate camera calibration based on corresponding points in soccer pitch. The vision engine has several processing modules including camera position estimation, camera pose exhaustive search for initializing pose tracker, shot boundary detection, Levenberg–Marquardt Based Optimizer and etc. Many AI techniques are utilized in this software such as GA, Kalman Smoothing, Optical Flow etc.

\paragraph{Computer Vision Expert @ \href{http://www.spadsystem.com/}{Spad System Co.} } \hfill April 2016 - present\\
Spadsystem is a startup software company that was founded in 2013. It specializes in accounting and management tools. Company started developing an automatic license plate recognition system for Iranian vehicles \href{http://didbaan.com}{(Didbaan)} and I joined the team in 2016 as a vision expert. My role is developing vision algorithms and also revising existing codes with OpenCV. I designed a tool for detecting moving objects using motion segmentation technique and also optimized an existing LBP descriptor to find the plates regions in the image. Furthermore I implemented a Persian OCR module using standard C++ libraries to extract the content of the plates.
