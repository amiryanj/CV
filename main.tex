\section{\centerline{Summary}}
\vspace{8pt} % Gap between title and text
I'm a Robotics and AI enthusiast who dedicated 7 years of his life to design, build and develop intelligent mobile robots. Having successfully completed formal studies in Electronics and then graduated from Sharif University of technology in AI, I'm seeking a PhD position that will allow me to further my understanding and conduct research in the area.


%To make contribution in the field of soccer robots to fulfill dream of Robocup 2050. I have  And the main ground for changing my major in M.Sc. was to acquire knowledge in different fields related to robotics.

% describe small size project
\paragraph{Team Leader @ \href{http://robocup.sbu.ac.ir}{Cyrus Robotics}}(Small-Size Soccer Team of Shahid Beheshti Univ.) \hfill 2010 - 2015\\
%A team of 6 small mobile robots play soccer on a green carpeted field that is 9 m long by 6 m wide. Small Size robot soccer focuses on the problem of intelligent multi-agent cooperation and control in a highly dynamic environment with a hybrid centralized/distributed system. 
Besides experiencing a professional team work management of seven graduate and undergraduate students, I heve been designing and developing electronic boards and embedded systems of the robots as electronic designer until 2012. During this period, a small wireless network was formed using Zigbee technology to enable communication between robots. Decision commands sent from Off-field computer were parsed and executed with ARM-based micro-controller that run a PI controller to  drive the robot wheels at a desired speed and trigger the kicker module.\\
After 2012 I joined the software group and rewritten AI codes to c++. I developed the motion planning module based on an idea in my MSc thesis. We also introduced an approach to improve the robot movements and compensating inaccuracies in robot building using a Takegi-Sugeno fuzzy method.
In 2014 we implemented a speech recognition system to convert human voice signals into robot commands in order to facilitate robot learning.

\paragraph{Computer Vision Expert @ Sepehr Etelaat Co.} (Related to Sharif Univ.) \hfill May 2015 - present\\
We are developing a software for adding virtual advertisement to sport videos. A main processing step in this system is to estimate camera calibration based on corresponding points in soccer pitch. The vision engine has several processing modules including camera position estimation, camera pose blind search for initializing pose tracker, shot boundary detection, Levenbergâ€“Marquardt Based Optimizer and etc. Many AI techniques are utilized in this software such as GA, Kalman Smoothing, Optical Flow etc.

\paragraph{Computer Vision Expert @ \href{http://www.didbaan.com/}{Spad System Co.} } \hfill April 2016 - present\\
We are designing an automatic license plate recognition system for Iranian vehicles. We extracted the foreground areas in video frames using motion segmentation technique, then using a simple LBP descriptor, plate regions will be detected. We utilized standard C++ libraries to train a Persian OCR system to extract plate text.
